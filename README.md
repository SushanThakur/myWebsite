You can copy codes if you want to.
If there is anything I can help you with, feel free to leave me a message on my instagram @sushant_404 

As I'm using free plan for hosting my weebsite on 000webhost, by-default the website is provided with a banner on bottom-right side. 
so, I used removeBanner.js (/js/removeBanner.js) to remove that banner. You can also remove that banner just by using that js file in your website.
